# Minirails

Minirails is a web server MVC framework written in Ruby, inspired by Rails. It is a learning project to help me better understand what Rails and other web frameworks do and how they might work by reimplementing some of their functionality. That reimplemented functionality includes a base model with object-relational mapping, a base controller that finds and renders associated ERB templates, a router that invokes controller actions associated with the request path, an interface for storing session data in a cookie, and protection against CSRF attacks via requiring any submitted forms to include a hidden field with a token that matches one stored in the session cookie.
